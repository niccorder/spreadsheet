# A toy implementation of a Spreadsheet application.

The stack is made up of the following libraries:
- RxJava - an awesome implementation of the Gang of Four's Observable pattern. A must have.
- Android support/design libraries - Awesome libraries for UI, and managing/handling older API's.
- Retrofit2 - A beautifully designed library to ease the implementation of RESTful endpoints.
- Realm - An awesome library for interacting with persistent databases on device.
- Dagger2 - Googles extention of Square's Dagger... used for dependency injection in the most awesome way.
